# Medical Image Classification for Disease Detection Using Neural Networks
# Abstract
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for medical image classification to assist in disease detection. Using a dataset of medical images, such as chest X-rays or histology slides, the project will train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images into different categories (e.g., detecting pneumonia or identifying cancerous cells). The model will be trained using supervised learning techniques, leveraging labeled medical datasets to improve accuracy.The primary objective is to explore the potential of deep learning in automating medical diagnosis, reducing human error, and improving early disease detection. The final deliverable will include a trained model, performance evaluation metrics, and a report detailing the methodology and findings.
